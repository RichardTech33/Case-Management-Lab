# Case Management Project Using TheHive

## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation and use of TheHive, an open-source Security Incident Response Platform (SIRP), for efficient case management and incident response. TheHive integrates seamlessly with various security tools, allowing analysts to collaboratively investigate and respond to security incidents. For this project, I will be using the task files from TryHackMe's "TheHiveProject" room to demonstrate proficiency and understanding of 

## Objectives

- Implement TheHive for managing security incidents.
- Demonstrate the integration of TheHive with other security tools.
- Showcase the workflow of creating, managing, and resolving cases.
- Highlight the automation capabilities of TheHive.

## Skills Learned

- Installation and configuration of TheHive.
- Integrating TheHive with other security tools.
- Managing security incidents using TheHive.
- Automating incident response workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
- Familiarity with incident response processes.
- Access to a virtual machine or server for installation.
- Installed and configured Elasticsearch (as TheHive relies on it).

## Setup

### Step 1: Install Elasticsearch

1. Download and install Elasticsearch from the [official website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
2. Start the Elasticsearch service:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start elasticsearch

### Step 2: Install TheHive

1. Download and install TheHive from the official website.
2. Configure TheHive by editing the configuration file located at /etc/thehive/application.conf:
    ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/thehive/application.conf
  Ensure that the configuration matches your environment settings, especially the Elasticsearch connection details.
  
3. Start TheHive service:
  ```sh
   sudo systemctl start thehive
```
### Step 3: Access TheHive

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:9000`.
2. Log in with the default credentials (admin:admin) and change the password upon first login.

## Usage

### Creating a Case
1. Click on the "New Case" button.
2. Fill in the case details, including title, description, and severity.
3. Save the case to start tracking the incident.

### Managing Cases
1. Assign tasks to team members.
2. Track the progress of each task and update the status accordingly.
3. Attach relevant evidence and observables to the case.

### Integrating with Security Tools
1. Configure integrations with security tools like MISP, Cortex, or SIEM solutions by editing the integration settings in TheHive.
2. Use the integrated tools to enrich case data and automate responses.

### Automating Workflows
1. Create automation rules in TheHive to trigger specific actions based on defined criteria.
2. Use Cortex analyzers and responders to automate analysis and response tasks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of TheHive for managing security incidents. By following the steps outlined above, you can set up TheHive, integrate it with other security tools, and automate various aspects of incident response. This enhances your ability to manage and respond to security incidents efficiently.
